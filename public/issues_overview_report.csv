"Issue Name","Issue Type","Issue Priority","URLs","% of Total","Description","How To Fix","Help URL"
"Hreflang: Not Using Canonical","Issue","High","9","100,000","URLs not using the canonical URL on the page in its own hreflang annotation. Hreflang should only include canonical versions of URLs.","Update hreflang annotations to include canonical versions of URLs only. They should not include links which are canonicalised to other URLs.",""
"Response Codes: Internal Client Error (4xx)","Issue","High","2","2,860","Internal URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as a 404 or 410 should be updated to their correct locations, removed and redirected where appropriate. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent' and crawling again.",""
"Hreflang: Multiple Entries","Issue","High","9","100,000","URLs with multiple entries to a language or regional code. For example, if page X links to page Y and Z using the same ‘en’ hreflang value annotation. This filter will also pick up multiple implementations, for example, if hreflang annotations were discovered as link elements and via HTTP header. While multiple implementations are permitted by Google, there’s no benefit and it can increase the likelihood of implementation error.","Update hreflang annotations to only use a language and region pair once, so they can be used for geotargeting the right audiences appropriately.",""
"Canonicals: Non-Indexable Canonical","Issue","High","9","100,000","Pages with a canonical URL that is non-indexable. This will include canonicals which are blocked by robots.txt, no response, redirect (3XX), client error (4XX), server error (5XX), are 'noindex' or 'canonicalised' themselves. This means the search engines are being instructed to consolidate indexing and link signals to a non-indexable page, which often leads to them ignoring the canonical, but may also lead to unpredictability in indexing and ranking. Export pages, their canonicals and status codes via 'Reports > Canonicals > Non-Indexable Canonicals'.","Ensure canonical URLs are to accurate indexable pages to avoid them being ignored by search engines, and any potential indexing or ranking unpredictability.",""
"Hreflang: Non-200 hreflang URLs","Issue","High","9","100,000","URLs contained within rel=""alternate"" hreflang annotations that do not have a 200 response code, such as URLs blocked by robots.txt, no responses, 3XX (redirects), 4XX (client errors) or 5XX (server errors). Hreflang URLs must be crawlable and indexable and therefore non-200 URLs are treated as errors, and ignored by the search engines. The non-200 hreflang URLs can be seen in the lower window 'URL Details' pane with a 'non-200' confirmation status. They can be exported in bulk via the 'Reports > Hreflang > Non-200 Hreflang URLs' export.","Ensure URLs within hreflang annotations are to the correct canonical and indexable pages. If Google can't see pages pointing to each other due to a non-200 response, the tags will be ignored.",""
